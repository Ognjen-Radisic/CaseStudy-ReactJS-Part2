In part-1 goal was to make a full project while only using vanilla js (no external ui librariries), html and sass. In part-2 I'll make the same project using React and sass. And we can compare the differences, in app structuring, code readability and simplicity in different aspects of making the same thing in a different way (with different technologies).

## Things specific in part-2 with react

- [ ] Sass structuring, using partials, and a variant of 7-1 pattern for structuring scss code.
- [ ] Changed styling, now its more compact and it has better UX.
- [ ] React structured and broken down into units in separate folders, with each having its own components.
- [ ] Assets better structured to improve readability and to figure out faster which asset belong to which component.
- [ ] Added global context for changing currency functionality and switching tabs in tabClasses component.
- [ ] Only external librabry added to project is aos (animation on scroll), and played around displaying offer cards with different delays.
- [ ] It's easily scalable, we can add more pages by simply adding new component in pages folder, and structure components to belong to its own page or to be shareable components like navbar or footer.
